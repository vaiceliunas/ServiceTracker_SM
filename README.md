# ServiceTracker_SM
This is a service tracker which was build as a demo task for tech interview.

Service documentation is posted as html file in root/Documentation and was build on swagger template. Live swagger documentation with demo calls can be seen when running the project.

System was built to use MS SQL database. In order to run it locally, you may need to run sql server and run create db scripts or import .bak file. Scripts, their order and bak file are all in root/db scripts folder.
In order to run it with existing MS SQL server, run the scripts inside the server and adjust connection string.

Unit tests are in the same solution, but different project. It was build using xUnit and MOQ.

All the methods are built using these headers [GET POST PATCH DELETE]
Only method that was modified was getting services based on label key value pair. In order to call it, you will need to set specific url (see in documentation)

Docker file was generated by visual studio and is in repository together with the project. Although I'm not good at this (YET!) and not sure of what it does and if it's legit.
